# Deep Learning Made Easy

This repository provides examples for those who want to start working in deep learning (DL), a subfield of machine learning (ML). Currently, the following source codes are available:


- PyTorch\_MNIST: Google Colab's notebook for the handwritten digit classification problem based on the classical Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) database. It uses three neural networks to address this problem: **SNN500** by [Aviv Shamsian] (https://github.com/AvivSham/Pytorch-MNIST-colab), **CNN3L** by [Nutan] (https://medium.com/@nutanbhogendrasharma/pytorch-convolutional-neural-network-with-mnist-dataset-4e8a4265e118), and **LeNet-5** by [Bolla Karthikeya] (https://github.com/bollakarthikeya/LeNet-5-PyTorch/blob/master/lenet5\_gpu.py);
- PyTorch\_CIFAR-10: Google Colab's notebook for the image classification problem based on the classical CIFAR-10 database. It is a modification of the [*Training a Classifier*] (https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html) PyTorch tutorial. It uses two neural networks to address this problem: **CNN3L** by [Nutan] (https://medium.com/@nutanbhogendrasharma/pytorch-convolutional-neural-network-with-mnist-dataset-4e8a4265e118) and **LeNet-5** presented in the *Training a Classifier* tutorial.
